## Documentation
You can browse the docs for ol-kit here on the site or in the `/docs` directory.

## Conventions
Whenever an OpenLayers object is referenced it is prefixed with `ol.` to denote it is not an ol-kit object. To learn more about an OpenLayers object type you can head over to their excellent [API docs](https://openlayers.org/en/latest/apidoc/index.html) and search for the object type, replacing all `.` with `/`.
