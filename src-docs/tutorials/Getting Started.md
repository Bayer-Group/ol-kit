## Jump In
Getting started with ol-kit is simple. We assume you already have a React application. If not, you can use something like [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/). There are a few `peerDependencies` required by ol-kit that need to be installed on your side (this avoids problems introduced by having multiple instances of these packages). Use this comprehensive install:
```
npm i @bayer/ol-kit ol react react-dom styled-components @material-ui/core @material-ui/icons @material-ui/styles --save
```

## Let's Get a Map on the Page
There are two ways to get started making a map: let ol-kit generate a default map for you or pass in a custom `ol.Map`. (note: the below examples use both classical and functional components from React- ol-kit works with both of these syntaxes.)

### Auto-Generate a Map
To get started quickly, you can let ol-kit create an `ol.Map` by simply importing & rendering the `Map` component.
```javascript
import React from 'react'
import { Map } from '@bayer/ol-kit'

const MyApp = () => <Map />
```

Without a reference to the map ol-kit created, you can't do anything useful. You can get around this by passing the `onMapInit` prop. This callback is called with one argument: an `ol.Map` instance created by ol-kit. Your application should save this for later interaction with the map and other OpenLayers APIs. (note: the map can also be passed implicitly by wrapping components with `connectToContext` util- learn about [how that works](../tutorial-connectToContext.html))
```javascript
import React from 'react'
import { Map } from '@bayer/ol-kit'

function App () {
  const onMapInit = map => {
    console.log('we got a map!', map)
  }

  return (
    <Map onMapInit={onMapInit} />
  )
}

export default App
```


### Pass a Custom Map
If you prefer creating your own `ol.Map` (see: [how to create a custom map](https://openlayers.org/en/latest/apidoc/module-ol_Map-Map.html)) you can ignore the `onMapInit` prop and instead pass the `map` prop like so:
```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react'
import { Map } from '@bayer/ol-kit'
import olMap from 'ol/Map'

class App extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)

    this.myMap = new olMap({...}) // see example code in link above
  }

  render () {
    return (
      <Map map={this.myMap} />
    )
  }
}

export default App
```

## Child Components
Applications will need to render children which overlay on top of the map and interact with it. Even though the ol-kit `Map` component renders a map to the page, it also includes a wrapper container allowing you to render custom application components as `children`. It can be as simple as a popup or a full-fledged routed application.

In the example below, the `Popup` and `Controls` components will be rendered "within" the bounds of the map and on top of the map surface.

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import { Map, Controls, Popup } from '@bayer/ol-kit'

function App () {
  const onMapInit = map => {
    console.log('we got a map!', map)
  }

  return (
    <Map onMapInit={onMapInit}>
      <Controls />
      <Popup />
    </Map>
  )
}

export default App
```

## Internal App
To run our internal app inside `ol-kit`, make sure to `npm install` and then run the command `npm run app` which will start the server on port 2020.

## Next Steps
Now that you have a map rendered, you probably want to make it awesome. Check out the components and tutorials provided by ol-kit that make it easy to add info popups, layer management, drawing capability, URI location tracking and much more.
