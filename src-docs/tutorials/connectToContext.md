# connectToContext
The `connectToContext` wrapping function that automatically passes a `map`, `translations`, and/or `selectInteraction` prop to its child component.

## How does it work?
When the `Map` component is constructed, it attaches the OpenLayers map to a [context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html). If this context exists (which means `Map` has been constructed), `connectToContext` renders its child with a prop of `map` from the `Map` parent and also spreads the rest of the inline props. If a `Map` is not mounted, `connectToContext` will just render the child and pass props through without consuming a context. `translations` and `selectInteraction` will also be passed through from the `<Map>`'s context. Optimization: if `propTypes` are defined on the component passed to `connectToContext`, this util will check the against `propTypes` and filter out any props mentioned above that are unneeded, if `propTypes` is not set, all props mentioned above will be passed.

## Automatic Example
All components provided by ol-kit are already wrapped, so a single-line drop-in is all you need to get it working:
```javascript
import React from 'react'
import { Map, Popup } from '@bayer/ol-kit'

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Map>
      <Popup /> {/* This Popup component was automatically given a map prop when wrapped by connectToContext internally */}
    </Map>
  )
}

export default App
```

## Manual Example
If you prefer to not use the `Map` component you must manually pass the `map` prop to all ol-kit components:
```javascript
import React from 'react'
import { Map, Popup } from '@bayer/ol-kit'

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Popup map={yourOlMap} />
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```

## Wrapping Your Components
Prebuilt ol-kit components get wrapped by this consumer before they are exported so they can be dropped in and just work. If you want to leverage the same logic, wrap your custom component like so:
```javascript
import React from 'react'
import PropTypes from 'prop-types'
import { connectToContext } from '@bayer/ol-kit'

const CustomMapComponent = props => {
  const { map } = props

  // do some logic with the map

  return (
    <div>This component has map as a prop!</div>
  )
}

CustomMapComponent.propTypes = {
  map: PropTypes.object.isRequired
}

export default connectToContext(CustomMapComponent)
```
The above example filtered out `translations` & `selectInteraction`...but if you do not define `propTypes`:
```javascript
import React from 'react'
import { connectToContext } from '@bayer/ol-kit'

const CustomMapComponent = props => {
  const { map, selectInteraction, translations } = props

  // access to all context props from <Map> parent

  return (
    <div>This component has map, selectInteraction, and translations props!</div>
  )
}

export default connectToContext(CustomMapComponent)
```
